# AI Agent Collaboration Log (AGENTS.md)

This document outlines the role, contributions, and interaction process with the AI agent involved in the development of the `django-allauth-vipps` package. The purpose is to maintain transparency about the use of AI in this project and to provide a log of its key contributions.

## 1. Agent Details

* **Name:** Gemini
* **Provider:** Google
* **Interaction Dates:** June 27, 2025
* **Nature of Agent:** A large language model trained by Google, functioning as a code generation and debugging partner.

## 2. Agent's Role in the Project

The AI agent was utilized as a pair-programming partner, primarily responsible for the following tasks under the supervision and direction of the human developer:

* **Initial Scaffolding:** Provided the initial file structure and `pyproject.toml` configuration for a reusable Django app package managed with Poetry.
* **Core Logic Implementation:** Generated the primary code for:
    * `vipps_auth/provider.py`: The `VippsProvider` class that defines how `django-allauth` communicates with the Vipps OpenID Connect API.
    * `vipps_auth/views.py`: The `VippsOAuth2Adapter` and the necessary views to connect the provider to the `allauth` framework.
    * `vipps_auth/settings.py`: A configuration helper to allow for easy customization of the package (e.g., switching between Vipps test and production URLs).
* **Test Suite Development:** Wrote the complete test suite in the `tests/` directory, including:
    * Unit tests for the `VippsProvider` (`tests/test_provider.py`).
    * A full integration test for the `dj-rest-auth` social login flow (`tests/test_flow.py`).
    * Implementation of mocking strategies using `unittest.mock.patch` and `requests-mock` to isolate the package from external network calls during testing.
* **Iterative Debugging:** Played a crucial role in the interactive debugging process. By analyzing `pytest` traceback logs provided by the human developer, the agent identified and corrected a series of progressively more subtle bugs, including:
    * Incorrect Python path configuration for `pytest`.
    * Missing Django settings (`MIDDLEWARE`, `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`, JWT configuration) in the test environment.
    * Bugs in the test implementation (e.g., incorrect `SocialApp` creation).
    * Subtle incompatibilities and `TypeError` exceptions arising from the interaction between the specific versions of `dj-rest-auth` and `django-allauth`.

## 3. Summary of Interaction and Development Process

The development of this package followed an iterative, conversational process between the human developer and the AI agent.

1.  **Initial Goal:** The process began with the high-level goal of creating a "drop-in" Django app for Vipps login.
2.  **Architectural Decision:** The agent suggested structuring the app as a standalone, reusable Python package to promote modularity and maintainability.
3.  **Code Generation:** The agent generated the initial code for all necessary files, including the provider, views, URLs, and test files.
4.  **Intensive Debugging Cycle:** The human developer ran the provided test suite, which initially failed. The traceback from each failure was fed back to the agent. This created a tight feedback loop where the agent would:
    * Diagnose the specific error (`ImproperlyConfigured`, `AttributeError`, `TypeError`, etc.).
    * Explain the root cause.
    * Provide corrected code.
5.  **Final Success:** After several iterations, this process successfully resolved all bugs, leading to a fully functional and tested package. The final breakthroughs involved identifying a known bug in a specific library version and adopting the correct, standard patterns for `allauth` provider and adapter implementation.

## 4. Environment Setup

To create a local development environment to work on or test this package, follow these steps. This assumes you have **Python 3.11+** and **Poetry** installed.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/danpejobo/django-allauth-vipps.git](https://github.com/danpejobo/django-allauth-vipps.git)
    cd django-allauth-vipps
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This is the main step. The `poetry install` command will read the `pyproject.toml` file, resolve all dependencies (both main and development), and install them into a dedicated virtual environment managed by Poetry.
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    To work within the project's environment, activate the shell created by Poetry.
    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```
    Your command prompt should now change to indicate you are inside the virtual environment (e.g., `(django-allauth-vipps-py3.11) ...`).

4.  **Run the Test Suite:**
    With the environment activated, you can verify that everything is set up correctly by running the complete test suite.
    ```bash
    poetry run pytest
    ```
    If the setup is successful, all 5 tests should pass. You are now ready to contribute to the package.

## 5. Human Oversight and Final Authority

All code, architectural decisions, and suggestions generated by the AI agent were reviewed, tested, and approved by the human developer (Daniel Persen). The human developer retains final authority and responsibility for the code in this repository. The agent served as a tool to accelerate development and assist in complex problem-solving.
